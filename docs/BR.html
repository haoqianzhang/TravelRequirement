Vaccinations not required.
<br />
Recommended:
- Vaccination against yellow fever for all travelers of 9
<br />  months of age and older going to the states of Acre, Amapa,
  Amazonas, Distrito Federal (including the capital city of
  Brasilia), Espirito Santo, Goias, Maranhao, Mato Grosso,
  Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Para, Parana, Piaui, Rio
  de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Rondonia, Roraima, Santa
  Catarina, Sao Paulo, Tocantins as well as to designated
<br />  areas of Bahia State. Vaccination is also recommended for
<br />  travelers visiting Iguazu Falls. 
<br />- Malaria risk due to P. vivax (88.8%), P. falciparum (10.6%),
  and mixed infections (0.5%) exists in most forested areas
<br />  below 900 meters within the nine states of the Amazon region
  (Acre, Amapa, Amazonas, Maranhao, Mato Grosso (northern
  part), Para (except Belem City), Rondonia, Roraima and
  Tocantins (western part)). Transmission intensity varies
<br />  from one municipality to another and is higher in
  junglemining areas, in agricultural settlements, in
  indigenous areas, and in some peripheral urban areas of
  Cruzeiro do Sul, Manaus and Porto Velho. Malaria also occurs
  on the periphery of large cities such as Boa Vista, Macapa,
<br />  Maraba, Rio Branco, and Santarem. In the states outside the
  administrative region of Amazonas, the risk of malaria
<br />  transmission is negligible or non-existent, but there is a
  residual risk of P. vivax transmission in Atlantic forest
<br />  areas of the states of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de
  Janeiro and Espirito Santo. Detailed information on the
<br />  epidemiological situation of malaria in Brazil is available
<br />  at <a href='http://www.saude.gov.br' target='_blank'>www.saude.gov.br</a>
  Recommended prevention in risk areas: B in P. vivax risk
<br />  areas; C in P. falciparum risk areas.
